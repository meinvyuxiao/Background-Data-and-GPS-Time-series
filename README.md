# Background-Data-and-GPS-Time-series

This is used to archieve the data enclosed in our recent paper submitted to Geophysical Research Letter
There are two folders containing GPS data and groundwater level contour in Tianjin.

1.GPS stations details and time series 
The data is processed by the second author of the paper, i.e., Dr.Guoquan Wang from University of Houton (https://github.com/bob-Github-2020/TianJin_Subsidence). The displacement time series of the main continuous GPS stations used in this study, i.e., JIXN, TJBD, TJWQ, QING, TJBH, and HECX are attached in this folder.


2.Data from Annual Tianjin Water Resources Bulletin 
This folder include the aquifer and precipitation data from the Tianjin Water Resources Bulletin (http://swj.tj.gov.cn/zwgk_17147/xzfxxgk/fdzdgknr1/tjxx/) from 2014 to 2021. The groundwater level contour maps in Aquifer 2 and Aquifer 3 and monthly precipitation figures are attached. The color and number on the contour maps show the different groundwater level in each aquifer.
